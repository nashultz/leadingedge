								<p>Tammy, I wanted to thank you for such a great job!!!   I was, at one time, an escrow officer, I have first hand 
								   experience in getting a property closed.  I did not have the experience, as a single woman, the process from 
								   saying "I want to buy this house" and to the signing the closing documents.  I am so amazed at the amount of 
								   events needed. You made each step easy...<br>
								   A.) Making sure I knew what I could afford.<br>
								   B.) Helping with a lender<br>
								   C.) Signing the contract<br>
								   D.) Negotiating the contract<br>
								   E.) Getting all inspections<br>
								   F.) Keep on top of the details<br>
								   G.) Keeping in touch with me as well as the lender.<br>
								   H.) Setting the exciting close date.<br>
								   I.) Working with the Title Company.<br>
								   J.) Bringing all parties together - I felt so comfortable at the closing... With the Escrow Officer and the Lender, yourself and me.<br>
								   Your ability to work in Tandem is so impressive!!!! You are a super person... Honest, Trust Worthy, Happy, SMART 
								   (at your job) ... You are a six star Realtor!  I am so fortunate to have you work with me and you made it possible 
								   for me to now have a home.  Tandem is a great idea but I have to say it all starts with you a your ability.  You 
								   are a super Realtor and person. I was really impressed with my loan officer and all his hard work. And the closer 
								   with Reliant Title was super..</p>
