				<div class="about">
					<p>All real estate licensees are not the same. Only real estate licensees who are members of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS&reg;
					 are properly called REALTORS&reg;. They proudly display the REALTOR "&reg;" logo on the business card or other marketing and sales 
					 literature. REALTORS&reg; are committed to treat all parties to a transaction honestly. REALTORS&reg; subscribe to a strict code of 
					 ethics and are expected to maintain a higher level of knowledge of the process of buying and selling real estate. An independent 
					 survey reports that 84% of home buyers would use the same REALTOR&reg; again.</p>
					
					<p>Real estate transactions involve one of the biggest financial investments most people experience in their lifetime. Transactions 
					today usually exceed $100,000. If you had a $100,000 income tax problem, would you attempt to deal with it without the help of a CPA? 
					If you had a $100,000 legal question, would you deal with it without the help of an attorney? Considering the small upside cost and 
					the large downside risk, it would be foolish to consider a deal in real estate without the professional assistance of a REALTOR&reg;.</p>
					
					<p>But if you're still not convinced of the value of a REALTOR&reg;, here are a dozen more reasons to use one:</p>
					
					<p>1. Your REALTOR&reg; can help you determine your buying power -- that is, your financial reserves plus your borrowing capacity. 
					If you give a REALTOR&reg; some basic information about your available savings, income and current debt, he or she can refer you to 
					lenders best qualified to help you. Most lenders -- banks and mortgage companies -- offer limited choices.</p>
					
					<p>2. Your REALTOR&reg; has many resources to assist you in your home search. Sometimes the property you are seeking is available but 
					not actively advertised in the market, and it will take some investigation by your agent to find all available properties.</p>
					
					<p>3. Your REALTOR&reg; can assist you in the selection process by providing objective information about each property. Agents who 
					are REALTORS&reg; have access to a variety of informational resources. REALTORS&reg; can provide local community information on 
					utilities, zoning. schools, etc. There are two things you'll want to know. First, will the property provide the environment I want 
					for a home or investment? Second, will the property have resale value when I am ready to sell?</p>
					
					<p>4. Your REALTOR&reg; can help you negotiate. There are myriad negotiating factors, including but not limited to price, financing, 
					terms, date of possession and often the inclusion or exclusion of repairs and furnishings or equipment. The purchase agreement 
					should provide a period of time for you to complete appropriate inspections and investigations of the property before you are bound 
					to complete the purchase. Your agent can advise you as to which investigations and inspections are recommended or required.</p>
					
					<p>5. Your REALTOR&reg; provides due diligence during the evaluation of the property. Depending on the area and property, this could 
					include inspections for termites, dry rot, asbestos, faulty structure, roof condition, septic tank and well tests, just to name a 
					few. Your REALTOR&reg; can assist you in finding qualified responsible professionals to do most of these investigations and provide 
					you with written reports. You will also want to see a preliminary report on the title of the property. Title indicates ownership of 
					property and can be mired in confusing status of past owners or rights of access. The title to most properties will have some 
					limitations; for example, easements (access rights) for utilities. Your REALTOR&reg;, title company or attorney can help you 
					resolve issues that might cause problems at a later date.</p>
					
					<p>6. Your REALTOR&reg; can help you in understanding different financing options and in identifying qualified lenders.</p>
					
					<p>7. Your REALTOR&reg; can guide you through the closing process and make sure everything flows together smoothly.</p>
					
					<p>8. When selling your home, your REALTOR&reg; can give you up-to-date information on what is happening in the marketplace and the 
					price, financing, terms and condition of competing properties. These are key factors in getting your property sold at the best price, 
					quickly and with minimum hassle.</p>
					
					<p>9. Your REALTOR&reg; markets your property to other real estate agents and the public. Often, your REALTOR&reg; can recommend 
					repairs or cosmetic work that will significantly enhance the salability of your property. Your REALTOR&reg; markets your property 
					to other real estate agents and the public. In many markets across the country, over 50% of real estate sales are cooperative 
					sales; that is, a real estate agent other than yours brings in the buyer. Your REALTOR&reg; acts as the marketing coordinator, 
					disbursing information about your property to other real estate agents through a Multiple Listing Service or other cooperative 
					marketing networks, open houses for agents, etc. The REALTOR&reg; Code of Ethics requires REALTORS&reg; to utilize these 
					cooperative relationships when they benefit their clients.</p>
					
					<p>10. Your REALTOR&reg; will know when, where and how to advertise your property. There is a misconception that advertising 
					sells real estate. The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS&reg; studies show that 82% of real estate sales are the result of 
					agent contacts through previous clients, referrals, friends, family and personal contacts. When a property is marketed with 
					the help of your REALTOR&reg;, you do not have to allow strangers into your home. Your REALTOR&reg; will generally prescreen 
					and accompany qualified prospects through your property.</p>
					
					<p>11. Your REALTOR&reg; can help you objectively evaluate every buyer's proposal without compromising your marketing position. 
					This initial agreement is only the beginning of a process of appraisals, inspections and financing -- a lot of possible 
					pitfalls. Your REALTOR&reg; can help you write a legally binding, win-win agreement that will be more likely to make it 
					through the process.</p>
					
					<p>12. Your REALTOR&reg; can help close the sale of your home. Between the initial sales agreement and closing (or settlement), 
					questions may arise. For example, unexpected repairs are required to obtain financing or a cloud in the title is discovered. 
					The required paperwork alone is overwhelming for most sellers. Your REALTOR&reg; is the best person to objectively help you 
					resolve these issues and move the transaction to closing (or settlement).</p>
